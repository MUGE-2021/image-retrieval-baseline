# MUGE Multimodal Retrieval Baseline

**Update: We have released a much more competitive MUGE retrieval baseline in our [Chinese-CLIP repo](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/Chinese-CLIP). More model scales and the technique report have all been released. We strongly recommend to try it!**

This repo is implemented based on the **[open_clip project](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)**, with modifications to adapt to the Chinese Multimodal Retrieval task

## Requirements and Installation
This repo is successfully tested on the following environment:

* python == 3.6.4
* pytorch == 1.7.1
* CUDA Version == 10.2

To install the requirements, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For other CUDA versions (9.2, 10.1, 11.0), please refer to this [guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#linux-and-windows-7) on official Pytorch website and edit the `requirements.txt` to correctly install the compatible version of `torch` and `torchvision`.

## Getting Started

Assume the downloaded dataset and downloaded pretrained weights are placed under this directory `${DATAPATH}`. The following experiment is performed on a single server with 8 V100-16G GPUs.

### Prepare CLIP and BERT Weights

In this repo, we build a [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) model and employ pretrained Openai ViT-B-16 ([download](https://openaipublic.azureedge.net/clip/models/5806e77cd80f8b59890b7e101eabd078d9fb84e6937f9e85e4ecb61988df416f/ViT-B-16.pt)) and Chinese RoBERTa (ymcui's [project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm), [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-2vEZfIFCdM1-vJ3GD6DlSyKT4eVXMKq/view?usp=drive_open)) weights to initialize the image-side and text-side, respectively.

For ViT-B-16 weight, run the following command to transform the checkpoint format from a JIT-model to state_dict:
```
python src/preprocess/transform_openai_pretrain_weights.py \ 
    --raw-ckpt-path ${DATAPATH}/ViT-B-16.pt \
    --new-ckpt-path ${DATAPATH}/ViT-B-16.state_dict.pt
```

For RoBERTa weight, unzip the downloaded zipfile and place the `pytorch_model.bin` under the `${DATAPATH}`.


### Prepare the Transformed Images

The images need to be transformed to feed into the CLIP model. However, online transformation during training and inference is slow. Here we perform the image transformation before the experiment.

```
python src/preprocess/transform_images.py \ 
    --data_dir ${DATAPATH} \
    --image_resolution 224
```

The transformed image dataset costs around 100G disk space.

### Training

```
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/src"
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

python -u src/training/main.py \
    --save-frequency 1 \
    --train-data="${DATAPATH}/train_queries.jsonl"  \
    --train-img="${DATAPATH}/train_imgs.224.npz"  \
    --val-data="${DATAPATH}/valid_queries.jsonl"  \
    --val-img="${DATAPATH}/valid_imgs.224.npz"  \
    --clip-weight-path="${DATAPATH}/ViT-B-16.state_dict.pt" \
    --bert-weight-path="${DATAPATH}/pytorch_model.bin" \
    --warmup 500 \
    --batch-size=32 \
    --lr=8e-5 \
    --wd=0.001 \
    --epochs=10 \
    --model ViT-B-16
```

The training will cost a few hours. The log and checkpoint files will be saved under the `logs` directory.

**Caution**: Since the training convergence and stablility of in-batch contrastive learning are highly dependent on the global batch-size. If you use a much smaller batch-size than the default setting (32 per-GPU \* 8 GPU), please try to use a smaller learning rate to avoid training divergence. (related [issue](https://github.com/MUGE-2021/image-retrieval-baseline/issues/1)). We recommend to use more GPUs and larger global batch-size to achieve more stable convergence and better model performance.

### Inference and Evaluation

Run the following command to compute image and query features using the trained CLIP model:

```
# only supports single-GPU inference
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0

python -u src/eval/extract_features.py \
    --extract-image-feats \
    --extract-text-feats \
    --image-data="${DATAPATH}/test_imgs.224.npz" \
    --text-data="${DATAPATH}/test_queries.jsonl" \
    --img-batch-size=32 \
    --text-batch-size=32 \
    --resume="logs/${experiment_name}/checkpoints/epoch_5.pt" \
    --model ViT-B-16
```

After obtaining the testing features, run the following command to perform kNN search to generate top-10 prediction jsonl file:
```
python -u src/eval/make_topk_predictions.py \
    --image-feats="${DATAPATH}/test_imgs.224.img_feat.jsonl" \
    --text-feats="${DATAPATH}/test_queries.txt_feat.jsonl" \
    --top-k=10 \
    --eval-batch-size=32768 \
    --output="${DATAPATH}/test_predictions.jsonl"
```

The jsonl file can be submitted to MUGE challenge site. In expectation, the evaluated model will get a **mean-recall of around 50**. We strongly believe the baseline can be easily tuned and improved to achieve much better points :)

We also provide the evaluation script to evaluate model's mean-recall on validation set. Run the following command:
```
python src/eval/evaluation.py valid_queries.jsonl valid_predictions.jsonl output.json
```
The score will be saved in `output.json`. The script is the same as the MUGE evaluation server.
